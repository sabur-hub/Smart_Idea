# Online Python Editor with Google and OpenAI Search Capability
This project is a simple online editor built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to write, execute, and test Python code directly in their web browsers. The editor features a responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices, including mobiles and tablets.

# Key Features:

# Python Editor:
Users can input Python code in a dedicated text area and execute it by clicking the "Run Code" button. The execution results will be displayed on the page.

# Google Search:
The project also offers the ability to perform Google searches. Users can input their search query in a designated text field and receive search results in the form of clickable links displaying the website domains and text.

# OpenAI Search:
The project supports searches using OpenAI. Users can enter their query in the text area and receive responses from OpenAI. The chat has the capability to remember the conversation context and allows for switching between different chats.

# Local Storage (LocalStorage):
Entered Python code, Google and OpenAI search results, and the code editor field are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence during page reloads or browser closures.

# Dark Theme and Custom Styles:
The editor features a stylish dark theme, providing an appealing visual design and enhanced readability.

# Server-Side:
To fully utilize the project's functionality, a server-side component written in Python using the Flask framework is required. This server-side component will handle requests for executing code, performing Google searches, and interacting with the OpenAI API.

# Version 0.2 Beta

I hope this online Python editor with search capabilities proves to be a valuable tool for programmers and individuals interested in Python development and exploration.
